Conduct that interferes with operations will not be tolerated. The Standards of Conduct are designed to be used to correct behavior. For the most part, they follow the principle of progressive discipline, i.e., warnings followed by increasing discipline depending on the type and frequency of offenses. If the offense is considered serious enough by the supervisor, then the employee may be terminated immediately without warning (i.e. theft or fraud (being punched in while performing non Corporate related functions)). Discipline under the Standards of Conduct will not be based on any employee's race, color, religion, gender, age, national origin, disability, or political affiliation. The standards were developed to protect the well-being and rights of all employees. The standards are intended to be illustrative but not all-inclusive. Accordingly, an offense which, in the judgment of management, although not listed in the policy, seriously undermines the effectiveness of the college's activities or the Employee's performance, is to be treated consistent with the provisions of the Standards of Conduct Policy.",

    "text": "Internet Policy. Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to ensure the proper use of the Company's internet system and make its employees and users aware of what the Company deems as acceptable and unacceptable use of its internet system. This policy also provides for sanctions in the event of a breach or violation of the policy terms hereunder. Applicability. This Policy applies to all users of company technology, including employees, contractors, vendors, partners, associates, and any other parties accessing or using the Company's System through on-site or remote terminals. Disclaimer of liability for use of Internet. The Company is not responsible for material viewed or downloaded by users from the Internet. The Internet is a worldwide network of computers that contains millions of pages of information. Users are cautioned that many of these pages include offensive, sexually explicit, and inappropriate material. In general, it is difficult to avoid at least some contact with this material while using the Internet. Even innocuous search requests may lead to sites with highly offensive content. In addition, having an e-mail address on the Internet may lead to receipt of unsolicited e-mail containing offensive content. Users accessing the Internet do so at their own risk. Duty not to waste computer resources. Employees must not deliberately perform acts that waste computer resources or unfairly monopolize resources to the exclusion of others. These acts include, but are not limited to, sending mass mailings or chain letters, spending excessive amounts of time on the Internet, playing games, engaging in online chat groups, printing multiple copies of documents, or otherwise creating unnecessary network traffic. Because audio, video and picture files require significant storage space, files of this or any other sort may not be downloaded unless they are business-related. No expectation of privacy. The computers and computer accounts given to employees are the exclusive property of the Company. No individual should have any expectation of privacy in any communication over this System. The System is to be used solely for company-related business, and is not to be used for personal business or pleasure. Monitoring computer usage. The Company reserves the right to monitor, intercept and/or review all data transmitted, received or downloaded over the System. Any individual who is given access to the System is hereby given notice that the Company will exercise this right periodically, without prior notice and without the prior consent of the employee. The Company's interests in monitoring and intercepting data include, but are not limited to: protection of company proprietary and classified data; managing the use of the Company's computer System; preventing the transmission or receipt of inappropriate materials by employees; and/or assisting the employee in the management of electronic data during periods of absence. No individual should interpret the use of password protection as creating a right or expectation of privacy. In order to protect everyone involved, no one can have a right or expectation of privacy with regards to the receipt, transmission or storage of data on the Company's Internet System. Blocking of inappropriate content. Company may use software to identify inappropriate or sexually explicit Internet sites. Such sites may be blocked from access by Company networks. In the event you nonetheless encounter inappropriate or sexually explicit material while browsing on the Internet, immediately disconnect from the site, regardless of whether the site was subject to company blocking software. Prohibited activities. Material that is fraudulent, harassing, embarrassing, sexually explicit, profane, obscene,intimidating, defamatory, or otherwise unlawful, inappropriate, offensive (including offensive material concerning sex, race, color, national origin, religion, age, disability, or other characteristic protected by law), or in violation of Company's equal employment opportunity policy and its policies against sexual or other harassment may not be downloaded from the Internet or displayed or stored in Company's computers. Employees encountering, witnessing or receiving this kind of material should immediately report the incident to their immediate supervisor and the person that signs your paycheck by phone. Company's equal employment opportunity policy and its policies against sexual or other harassment apply fully to the use of the Internet and any violation of those policies is grounds for discipline up to and including discharge. Games and entertainment software. Employees may not use the Company's Internet connection to download games or other entertainment software, including wallpaper and screen savers, or to play games over the Internet. Illegal copying. Employees may not illegally copy material protected under copyright law or make that material available to others for copying. You are responsible for complying with copyright law and applicable licenses that may apply to software, files, graphics, documents, messages, and other material you wish to download or copy.

Accessing the Internet. To ensure security and to avoid the spread of viruses, employees accessing the Internet through a computer attached to Company's network must do so through an approved Internet firewall. Accessing the Internet directly by modem is strictly prohibited unless the computer you are using is not connected to the Company's network. Virus detection. Files obtained from sources outside the Company, including disks brought from home; files downloaded from the Internet, newsgroups, bulletin boards, or other online services; files attached to e-mail; and files provided by customers or vendors may contain dangerous computer viruses that may damage the Company's computer network. Employees should never download files from the Internet, accept e-mail attachments from outsiders, or use disks from non-company sources, without first scanning the material with company-approved virus checking software. If you suspect that a virus has been introduced into the Company's network, notify the Help Desk immediately. Sending unsolicited e-mail (spamming).

View Larger Chart INITIAL NOTICE OF COBRA CONTINUATION COVERAGE RIGHTS CONTINUATION COVERAGE RIGHTS UNDER COBRA Introduction If you chose to be covered under your employer\u2019s health insurance plan (the Plan), the following is your notice of COBRA continuation coverage rights. This notice contains important information about your right to COBRA coverage, which is a temporary extension of group health coverage under the Plan under certain circumstances when coverage would otherwise end. This notice generally explains COBRA coverage, when it may become available to you and your family, and what you need to do to protect the right to receive it. COBRA (and the description of COBRA coverage contained in this notice) applies only to the group health plan benefits offered under the Plan (the Medical, Dental, Vision, and Health FSA components, if applicable) and not to any other benefits offered under the Plan. The right to COBRA coverage was created by a federal law, Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). COBRA coverage can become available to you when you would otherwise lose your group health coverage under the Plan(s). It can also become available to your spouse and dependent children, if they are covered under the Plan when you would otherwise lose their group health coverage under the Plan. This notice does not fully describe COBRA coverage or other rights under the Plan. For additional information about your rights and obligations under the Plan and under federal law, you should review the Plan's summary plan description or contact Laurie Green, which is the Plan administrator. The Plan provides no greater COBRA rights than what COBRA requires- nothing in this notice is intended to expand your rights beyond COBRA requirements. What is COBRA coverage? COBRA coverage is a continuation of Plan coverage when coverage would otherwise end because of a life event known as a \u201cqualifying event.\u201d Specific qualifying events are listed later in the notice. After a qualifying event occurs and any required notice of that event is properly provided to Laurie Green, COBRA coverage must be offered to each person losing Plan coverage who is a \u201cqualified beneficiary.\u201d You, your spouse, and your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries and would be entitled to elect COBRA if coverage under the Plan is lost because of the qualifying event. (Certain newborns, newly adopted children, and alternate recipients under QMCSOs may also be qualified beneficiaries. This is discussed in more detail in separate paragraphs below.) Under the Plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA must pay for COBRA coverage. Who is Entitled to Elect COBRA? If you are an employee and elected to be covered under the Plan, you will be entitled to elect COBRA if you will lose your group health coverage under the Plan because either one of the following qualifying events happens: \u2022 Your hours of employment are reduced, or \u2022 Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct. If you are the spouse of an employee, you will be entitled to elect COBRA if you lose your group health coverage under the Plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: \u2022 Your spouse dies; \u2022 Your spouse's hours of employment are reduced; \u2022 Your spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; \u2022 You become divorced or legally separated from your spouse. Also if your spouse(the employee) reduces or eliminates your group health coverage in anticipation of a divorce or legal separation, and a divorce or legal separation later occurs, then the divorce or legal separation may be considered a qualifying event for you even though your coverage was reduced or eliminated before the divorce or separation. A person enrolled as the employee's dependent child will be entitled to elect COBRA if he or she loses group health coverage under the Plan because",

Also if your spouse(the employee) reduces or eliminates your group health coverage in anticipation of a divorce or legal separation, and a divorce or legal separation later occurs, then the divorce or legal separation may be considered a qualifying event for you even though your coverage was reduced or eliminated before the divorce or separation. A person enrolled as the employee's dependent child will be entitled to elect COBRA if he or she loses group health coverage under the Plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: \u2022 The parent-employee dies; \u2022 The parent-employee's hours of employment are reduced; \u2022 The parent-employee's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; \u2022 The child stops being eligible for coverage under the Plan as a \u201cdependent child.\u201d When is COBRA Coverage Available? When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of hours of employment or death of the employee, the Plan will offer COBRA coverage to qualified beneficiaries. In addition, if the Plan provides retiree health coverage, then commencement of a proceeding in a bankruptcy with respect to the employer is also a qualifying event. You need not notify LAURIE@MACKINAW-CITY.COM of any of these events. You Must Give Notice of Some Qualifying Events For the other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the employee and spouse or a dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a dependent child), a COBRA election will be available to you only if you notify Laurie Green in writing within 60 days after the later of (1) the date of qualifying event; and (2) the date on which the qualified beneficiary loses (or would lose) coverage under the terms of the Plan as a result of the qualifying event. In providing this notice, you must use the Plan's form entitled \"Notice of Qualifying Event Form\" you may obtain a copy of this form from LAURIE@MACKINAW-CITY.COM at no charge, and you must follow the notice procedures specified at the end of this notice entitled \"Notice Procedures.\" If these procedures are not followed or if the notice is not provided to your employer during the 60-day notice period, THEN ALL QUALIFIED BENEFICIARIES WILL LOSE THEIR RIGHT TO ELECT COBRA.. Electing Cobra Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA coverage. Covered employees and spouses (if the spouse is a qualified beneficiary) may elect COBRA coverage on behalf of all the qualified beneficiaries, and parents may elect COBRA coverage on behalf of their children. Any qualified beneficiary for whom COBRA is not elected within the 60-day election period specified in the Plan's COBRA election notice WILL LOSE HIS OR HER RIGHT TO ELECT COBRA. How Long Does COBRA Coverage Last? COBRA coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage. When the qualifying event is the death of the employee, the covered employee's divorce or legal separation, or a dependent child's losing eligibility as a dependent child, COBRA coverage under the Plan's Medical, Dental and Vision component(s), if applicable, can last for up to a total of 36 months. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the employee's hours of employment, and the employee became entitled to Medicare benefits less than 18 months before the qualifying event, COBRA coverage under the Plan's Medical, Dental and Vision component(s), if applicable, for qualified beneficiaries (other than the employee) who lose coverage as a result of the qualifying event can last until up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement. For example, if a covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare 8 months before the date on which their employment terminates, COBRA coverage for their spouse and children who lost coverage as a result of their termination can last up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement, which is equal to 28 months after the date of the qualifying event (36 months minus 8 months). This COBRA coverage period is available only if the covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare within 18 months BEFORE the termination or reduction of hours. Otherwise, when the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the employee's hours of employment, COBRA coverage under the Plan's Medical, Dental and Vision components generally can last for only up to a total of 18 months. COBRA coverage under the Health FSA Reimbursement Account component, if applicable, can last only until the end of the year in which the qualifying event occurred-see the paragraph below entitle \"Health FSA Component,\" The Cobra coverage periods described above are maximum coverage periods.

COBRA coverage can end before the end of the maximum coverage periods described in this notice for several reasons, which are described in the Plan's summary plan description. There are two ways (described in the following paragraphs) in which the period of COBRA coverage resulting from a termination of employment or reduction of hours can be extended. (The period of COBRA coverage under the Health FSA cannot be extended under any circumstances). Disability extension of 18-month period of continuation coverage If a qualified beneficiary is determined by the Social Security Administration to be disabled and you notify the employer in a timely fashion, all of the qualified beneficiaries in your family may be entitled to receive up to an additional 11 months of COBRA coverage, for a total maximum of 29 months. This extension is available only for qualified beneficiaries who are receiving COBRA coverage because of a qualifying event that was the covered employee's termination of employment or reduction of hours. The disability must have started at some time before the 61st day after the covered employee's termination of employment or reduction of hours and must last at least until the end of the period of COBRA coverage that would be available without the disability extension(generally 18-months, as described above). The disability extension is available only if you notify the employer in writing of the Social Security Administration\u2019s determination of disability within 60 days after the latest of: \u2022 the date of the Social Security Administration's disability determination; \u2022 the date of the covered employee's termination of employment or reduction of hours; and \u2022 the date on which the qualified beneficiary loses (or would lose) coverage under the terms of the Plan as a result of the covered employee's termination of employment or reduction of hours. You must also provide this notice within 18 months after the covered employees termination of employment or reduction of hours in order to be entitled to a disability extension. You must notify Laurie Green and you must follow the procedures specified in the box at the end of this notice entitled \u201cNotice Procedures.\u201d If these procedures are not followed or if the notice is not provided to the employer during the 60-day notice period and within 18 months after the covered employees termination of employment or reduction of hours, THEN THERE WILL BE NO DISABILITY EXTENSION OF COBRA COVERAGE. Second qualifying event extension of COBRA coverage If your family experiences another qualifying event while receiving COBRA coverage because of the covered employee's termination of employment or reduction of hours (including COBRA coverage during a disability extension period as described above), the spouse and dependent children receiving COBRA coverage can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if notice of the second qualifying event is properly given to the Plan. This extension may be available to the spouse and any dependent children receiving COBRA coverage if the employee or former employee dies or gets divorced or legally separated, or if the dependent child stops being eligible under the Plan as a dependent child, but only if the event would have caused the spouse or dependent child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred. (This extension is not available under the Plan when a covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare after his or her termination of employment or reduction of hours.) This extension due to a second qualifying event is available only if you notify Laurie Green that works for employer in writing of the second qualifying event within 60 days after the date of the second qualifying event. In providing this notice, you must use the Plan\u2019s form entitled \u201cNotice of Qualifying Event Form\u201d, and you must follow the procedures specified in the box at the end of this notice entitled \u201cNotice Procedures.\u201d If these procedures are not followed or if the notice is not provided to the employer during the 60-day notice period, THEN THERE WILL BE NO EXTENSION OF COBRA COVERAGE DUE TO A SECOND QUALIFYING EVENT.

Health FSA Reimbursement Accounts Component, if applicable COBRA coverage under the Health FSA will be offered only to qualified beneficiaries losing coverage who have underspent accounts. A qualified beneficiary has an underspent account if the annual limit elected by the covered employee, reduced by the reimbursable claims submitted up to the time of the qualifying event, is equal to or more than the amount of the premiums for Health FSA COBRA coverage that will be charged for the remainder of the plan year. COBRA coverage will consist of the Health FSA coverage in force at the time of the qualifying event (i.e., the elected annual limit reduced by reimbursable claims submitted up to the time of the qualifying event). The use-it-or-lose-it rule will continue to apply, so any unused amounts will be forfeited at the end of the plan year, and COBRA coverage will terminate at the end of the plan year. Unless otherwise elected, all qualified beneficiaries who were covered under the Health FSA will be covered together for Health FSA COBRA coverage. However, each qualified beneficiary could alternatively elect separate COBRA coverage to cover that beneficiary only, with a separate Health FSA annual limit and a separate premium. If you are interested in this alternative, contact LAURIE@MACKINAW-CITY.COM for more information. More Information About Individuals Who May Be Qualified Beneficiaries Children born to or placed for adoption with the covered employee during COBRA coverage period A child born to, adopted by, or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of COBRA coverage is considered to be a qualified beneficiary provided that, if the covered employee is a qualified beneficiary, the covered employee has elected COBRA coverage for himself or herself. The child\u2019s COBRA coverage begins when the child is enrolled in the Plan, whether through special enrollment or open enrollment, and it lasts for as long as COBRA coverage lasts for other family members of the employee. To be enrolled in the Plan, the child must satisfy the otherwise applicable Plan eligibility requirements (for example, regarding age). Alternate recipients under QMCSOs A child of the covered employee who is receiving benefits under the Plan pursuant to a qualified medical child support order (QMCSO) received by the employer during the covered employee\u2019s period of employment with the company is entitled to the same rights to elect COBRA as an eligible dependent child of the covered employee.

For more information about your rights under ERISA, including COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other laws affecting group health plans, contact the nearest Regional or District Office of the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) in your area or visit the EBSA website at www.dol.gov/ebsa.

Otherwise, the Effective Date is February 21, 2025. Employer has made the following changes to our paid time off policies in compliance with Michigan\u2019s Earned Sick Time Act: \u00b7 ALL employees regardless of status (full-time, part-time, temporary, seasonal, hourly, salary, etc.) will begin accruing one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked as of the applicable Effective Date above or your start date, whichever is later. \u00b7 The use of your accrued paid sick time is subject to an initial 120-day waiting period after the date when you commence employment. \u00b7 Accrued sick time can be used in one-minute increments with as much notice as is practicable given the circumstances of the absence. It is our policy to require at least 72 hours\u2019 notice of any absence. If the absence is foreseeable, it is our policy to require at least seven (7) days\u2019 notice before the date when the earned sick time is to begin. \u00b7 If Employer has ten (10) or less employees, once accrued, you can use up to 72 hours accrued sick time per year. Otherwise, once accrued, you can use up to 72 hours of sick time each year. \u00b7 If Employer has ten (10) or less employees, any accrued, unused sick time will carry over from year to year up to 40 hours maximum. Otherwise, any accrued, unused sick time will carry over from year to year up to 72 hours maximum. However, a 2-month interruption in employment will result in loss of all accrued stick time. \u00b7 For the purposes of this policy, Employer defines a \u201cyear\u201d as beginning on January 1 and running for 12 consecutive months. \u00b7 Accrued, unused sick time is not eligible for payout at the time of separation nor at the end of a benefit year. Employees can use accrued sick time for any of the following reasons: (a) The employee\u2019s mental or physical illness, injury or health condition; medical diagnosis, care or treatment of the employee\u2019s mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or preventative medical care for the employee. (b) For the employee\u2019s family member\u2019s mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; medical diagnosis, care or treatment of the employee\u2019s family members\u2019 mental or physical illness, injury or health condition; or preventive medical care for a family member of the employee. (c) If the employee or the employee\u2019s family member is a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault, for medical care or psychological or other counseling for physical or psychological injury or disability; to obtain services from a victim services organization; to relocate due to domestic violence or sexual assault; to obtain legal services; or to participate in any civil or criminal proceedings related to or resulting from the domestic violence or sexual assault. (d) For meetings at a child\u2019s school or place of care related to the child\u2019s health or disability, or the effects of domestic violence or sexual assault on the child; or (e) For the closure of the employee\u2019s place of business by order of a public official due to a public health emergency; for an employee\u2019s need to care for a child whose school or place of care has been closed by order of a public official due to a public health emergency; or when it has been determined by the health authorities having jurisdiction or by a health care provider that the employee\u2019s or employee\u2019s family member\u2019s presence in the community would jeopardize the health of others because of the employee\u2019s or family member\u2019s exposure to a communicable disease, whether or not the employee or family member has actually contracted the communicable disease. You will not be penalized or retaliated against in any way for requesting or using your accrued paid sick time for the purposes designated above.
